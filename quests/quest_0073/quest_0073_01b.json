      "text": "Thanks for listening to my request. I've recently taken an interest in forestry, and thus I have been studying a lot about trees in our dimension; However it seems that there are other peculiar types of trees in other dimensions such as Everbright and Everdawn. Do you think you can help me gather a block of $(red)Dusk Leaves, Maple Leaves, and Starlight Leaves$() each for my research? "
